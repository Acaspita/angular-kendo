# Official AngularJS integration included in Kendo UI

The Angular-Kendo integration is already added officially in [Kendo UI Professional](http://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui) and [Kendo UI Core](http://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui/open-source-core), and supported as part of Kendo UI Professional. Therefore, loading `angular-kendo.js`  from this repository is no longer necessary, since it is deprecated. We strongly recommend using the official Angular integrations as only these will be developed and supported in the future, along with new versions of Angular.

For more information regarding how to use Kendo UI and Angular together, please refer to [this page](http://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui/angularjs-and-kendo-ui-framework-integration) and the [official docs](http://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/AngularJS/introduction).
